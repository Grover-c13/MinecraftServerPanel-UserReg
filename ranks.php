        <b><u>Rules of Ranking:</u></b><br />
        <br />
        <b>1. Don't ask about rank-ups.</b><br />
        Rank-ups will be performed at the decision of a moderator or administrator. Asking for a rank-up will not succeed, and will only cause those in charge to become less likely to consider you for a rank-up. This includes 'reminders' and even joking about it too much.<br />
        <br />
        <b>2. Everybody deserves your respect.</b><br />
        Holding a higher rank than another player does not permit you to disrespect or treat them any differently. <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <b><u>Ranks:</u></b><br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <b class="mcf7">1. Miner - |M|</b> (Formerly old Builder)<br />
        You'll start off as a Miner! You'll have basic access to the majority of the server, though you will be restricted from using potentially damaging items such as fire, lava, or TNT. If you enjoy the server and wish to have more access to its features, you can register <a href="http://mc.icannt.org/">on the main page</a> and gain instant access to the next rank!<br />
        <br />
        <b class="mcf6">2. Builder - |B|</b> (Formerly Expert)<br />
        If you chose to register, then you'll get your first rank up! As a builder you gain access to some new, very helpful commands such as /back, and /tpa which allows you to request teleports without needing to ask a mod, as well as the ability to get future promotions.<br />
        <br />
        <b class="mcf2">3. Planner - |P|</b> (Formerly VIP)<br />
        If we really like you, and value you as a member of the community, you will be promoted to Planner. Planners get a shiny new green name, access to a few new commands such as warping, as well as access to any special worlds that might be set up at the time.<br />
        <br />
        <b class="mcf3">4. Architect - |A|</b> (NEW)<br />
        If you stick around for a long time, and we deem you an important member of our community, you'll be promoted to Architect. Architect is the highest rank that most players will achieve, and allows you access to listing warps, as well as setting multiple homes! <br />
        <br />
        <b class="mcf9">5. Moderator - |MOD|</b><br />
        Responsible players who have a history of being helpful members of the community for a good amount of time might get offered the chance to make a contribution to the server as a moderator. As a mod you can kick and/or ban griefers, and teleport without having to ask, but you also have to go out of your way to help others with your new moderation commands. Treat the mods with respect and remember that while they do have to help you, they also want to play the game themselves.<br />
        <br />
        <b class="mcf4">6. Admin - |IC|</b><br />
        Admins run the server and are the higher powers in the community. They help run the server and make the important decisions. If you have any server suggestions or just want to ask a question that a mod might not know, these guys are the ones to look out for.<br />
        <br />
        <b>7. Superadmin - |IC|</b><br />
        Superadmins generally have direct console access, every permission, Vanilla OP enabled and most of them also run the ICannt forums. They may pick their own rank colouring based on personal preference.<br />
        <br />
        <b class="mcf2">IRC - [IRC]</b><br />
        Not actually a rank but chat via IRC from our IRC server irc.icannt.org on SSL port 6697. May also feature relayed chat from our modpack server.<br />
