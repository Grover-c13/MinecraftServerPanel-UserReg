        These are the official rules of the ICannt Minecraft server. By leaving our spawn hub, you agree to these rules and are liable to any punishment you may incur by disobeying them.<br />
        <br />
        <b>1. No griefing or stealing.</b><br />
        This includes any chests or structures out in the wild that might look abandoned. You never know when a player will return to the server!<br />
        <br />
        <b>2. Stay respectful to others in chat.</b><br />
        We won't punish for the occasional swear word or caps, but try not to over-use them. We aim to keep the server as a relaxed environment, but we still want it to be friendly and welcoming. <br />
        <br />
        <b>3. No client-side mods that give you an unfair advantage over other players.</b><br />
        Things such as mini-maps and advanced HUDs are acceptable, but X-Ray and other exploitations will be cause for a ban.<br />
        <br />
        <b>4. Do not ask moderators or administrators to spawn you in items, or to give you creative mode/other advantages.</b><br />
        We aim to keep this server fair for all, and as such, favours will only be given in extreme circumstances (such as in the rare case of a glitch or world error deleting your items.) This also means that you will not have your items given back if you die in lava or other similar things. Be careful! We have a creative world if you do not like the penalties that can occur in Survival.<br />
        <br />
        <b>5. Do not ask for ranks.</b><br />
        For more information, see the <a href="http://mc.icannt.org/ranks.php">page on ranks.</a><br />
        <br />
        <b>6. Admin and Moderator decisions are final.</b><br />
        They are the decision makers on the server, and can be trusted to make the right choices.<br />
        <br />
        <b>7. Survival Etiquette - Be a good citizen</b><br />
        &bull; If you are building near an inhabited area at least try and ask the occupants before building there. Don't build large ugly structures that you know other players won't like.<br />
        &bull; If you need some produce from a farm, replant what you take, also ask the occupants in the area first if you can.<br />
        &bull; If you remove trees for wood, no matter where you are, remove the whole tree, don't leave floating logs and leaves.<br />
