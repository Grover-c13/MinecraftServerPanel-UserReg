# MinecraftServerPanel-UserReg
A user panel for administrators to manage minecraft servers running pex + a registration system for new users to join the server.

Made for the ICannt servers back in 2015. There are several things wrong with this, IIRC there is an exploit to bypass the registration with javascript (i figured if someone went to that effort to bypass it they can have user status).
The layout of the files is not really ideal either, but hopefully this is proof enough i at least have some experience in php/html/css/javascript.
